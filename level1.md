# Today's Coding Contest is the 40th CCC

## To celebrate this big milestone, we took inspiration from

## one of the most liked previous contests, which was

## about steering a fleet of drones.

## This year's contest will be about steering

## just one drone.

▪ In this level the drone can only fly up or down
▪ The time of a flight is measured in ticks
▪ For every tick you are given the velocity at that time
▪ If the drone is flying up, the velocity is positive
▪ If the drone is flying down, the velocity is negative
▪ Every tick, the drone’s height will be updated based on the current velocity
▪ At the beginning, the drone is at height 0
▪ The height will never be negative during the flight
▪ The drone took multiple flights
▪ For each flight calculate the drone's final height
